# The open bond-calculus repo
This repo is intended as a demonstration of the capabilities of the [bond-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07603) to model biochemical systems and explore their behaviour. It also shows how Logic of Behviour in Uncertain Contexts can be used to conduct system verification on biochemical systems.
